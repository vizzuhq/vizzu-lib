## Why on(), off(), feature() methods fail after constructor call?

The Vizzu constructor has to load Vizzu's WebAssembly module asynchronously to prevent blocking the whole page. 
Because of this, any method except `animate()` will throw an exception while the library is not initialized. 

There is an `initializing` promise in the Vizzu class, which will resolve when initialization is finished. You can call all methods after
this promise is resolved.
