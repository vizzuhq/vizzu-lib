## [0.10.1] - 2024-03-12

### Added

- Updated `type-fest` dependency version to `4.12.0`

## [0.10.0] - 2024-03-11

### Fixed

- Fixed crash on splitted chart with no measure.
- Fixed refresh of chart when duration is 0.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-11-10

### Fixed

- Implemented deep copying of received values to ensure the original data 
  remains unchanged during subsequent modifications.
- detach() won't fail on not initialized chart.
- detach() removes the canvas if it was created by the lib. 
- When the labelLevel was set to a value other than 0, the axis labels were 
  not displayed correctly.
- From now orientation is a persistent setting too.
- Order-independent channel input processing.
- Filtered out markers were taken into account for measure type, and waterfall
  chart dimension axis ranges.
- When measure set on color channel, the color changes alongside the color range
  instead of blending the starting and ending colors.

  cause multi-step animations.

  is not explicitly set

  series
- Layout stretched to the bottom of the canvas. 
- Legend accepts only the acceptable channel values.
- From now the dimension axis title is shown if set.

### Added

- Event objects are containing the element of the chart which the events were 
  triggered on.
- Drawing events are containing drawing geometry in an improved format.
- Missing TypeScript definitions for Event objects added.
- Orientation new default parameter: `auto`.
- New dataseries `unit` parameter introduced, undocumented unit parsing from 
  parameter name string removed.
- New parameters for the chart: `subtitle` and `caption`.
- New `speed` parameter introduced for animation control object for setting 
  the speed of the animation.
- Wasm module gets loaded only once, not per chart. Load can be triggered optionally
  without any chart calling the `Vizzu.initialize()` method, otherwise will be 
  initialized automatically on first chart creation.
- Plugin interface introduced, new plugins can be registed through `Vizzu.feature()`.
- CSS parameter usage feature is disabled by default and can be enabled through
  `Vizzu.feature()` with name `cssProperties`.
- `shorthands`, `pointerEvents`, `pivotData`, `rendering` features can be disabled through
  `Vizzu.feature()`
- TypeScript interface made more typesafe, while the javascript api got ported to TypeScript.

  between canvas and relative coordinates.


## [0.8.1] - 2023-08-15

### Fixed

- Unregistering was not working correctly when the same callback was added for
  multiple events. (#75)
- The plot.marker.label.color setting now works in a way that modifies the
  previously calculated color based on the transparency channel of the color
  setting. (#144)
- When rapidly clicking multiple times while the selection animation has not
  finished, the library is aborted due to an exception.
- At times, the chosen marker would disappear from the selections during
  rapid mouse actions, leading to an exception being triggered.
- Sometimes, during mouse actions, when the tooltip animation disappeared, the
  marker information was null. With a new mouse action, when other tooltip 
  appeared, the marker transformation went from null to null, which caused an
  exception.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-07-12

### Fixed

- Missing Area/line marker rewireing (on orientation change,
  base dimension change) added.
- Fixed line drawing for line segments partially outside of the plot.
- Fixed label position for marker in polar origo.
- Axis labels won't shift if their 'side' style changed but
  their 'position' style is also changing or they are fading out anyway.
- Axis labels won't fade in partially when fading out but their 'position'
  style is also changing.
- Axis titles fade-in/out when changing position instead of traveling through
  the chart.
- Axis titles are rotating with the axis during cartesian/polar coordinate
  system change.

  animations.

- Vertical polar area chart tangential borders "follow" the coordinate system
  instead of being forced to remain straight.

### Added

- New&renamed mouse events: pointeron, pointermove, pointerdown, pointerup
- New drawing events: draw-begin, draw-complete, plot-area-draw
- 'step' channel config parameter for set interlacing/tick/label intervals
  on axises.
- 'plot.areaColor' style parameter added.
- Marker click works mid-animation.
- Various aggregator functions for channels beside previous sole summing:
  'min()', 'max()', 'mean()', 'sum()', 'count()', 'distinct()'.

- Data records can be specified via objects beside arrays.
- Area/line rewiring animation (aka. connection) can be configured separately
  in animation options.

  transitioning between charts having the data grouped differently on them
  (containing a different set of categorical dataseries).

- 'style' property returns the style object only filled with the user-set
  values, all the values (returned by this property till 0.6.x) can be get
  using the new 'getComputedStyle()' method.
- detach() method added to JS API for enabling proper garbage collection.
- Actual animation can be stored for later reuse through Anim.Control.store()
