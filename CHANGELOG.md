# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Title animation timing on first chart fixed.
- Fixed line drawing for line segments partially outside of the plot.
- Fixed garbage collection of stored charts and animations.

### Added

- New events added: mousedown, mouseup

## [0.7.0] - 2023-02-23

### Fixed

- Fixed the UnPivot.convert method not modifying the original data object.
- Axis line, labels, ticks, interlacing and guide can be set to auto.
- Simple fade in case of empty target chart
- Fixed length serialization in style() for % unit.
- Fixed missing rendering update when duration is 0 in first animate call. 
- Fixed error on multiple calls of the JS chart's 'data' property.
- Fixed disapearing title from empty charts.
- Fixed animation cancelling, did not trigger promise rejection.
- Fixed chart state reset on animation cancel. Used the target chart's config 
  further on despite the cancellation.
- Fixed the type definition of Snapshot in the d.ts file.

### Added

- 'regroupStrategy' animation option introduced to control the algorithm for 
  transitioning between charts having the data grouped differently on them 
  (containing a different set of categorical dataseries).
- Multi keyframe animation support (one animation through multiple chart).
- 'style' property returns the style object only filled with the user-set 
  values, all the values (returned by this property till 0.6.x) can be get
  using the new 'getComputedStyle()' method.
- detach() method added to JS API for enabling proper garbage collection.
- Actual animation can be stored for later reuse through Anim.Control.store()
  method.
- animate() returned promise is not an animation controller object from now on,
  but has a member promise called 'activated', which resolves to the controller.
- New style parameter, 'numberScale' has been introduced for setting the scale 
  system for big numbers e.g.: K M B T or k m bn tn.
- Improved default options for animations: marker geometry, marker fade-in,
  marker position, coordinate system, title.
