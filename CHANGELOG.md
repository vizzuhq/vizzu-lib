## [0.8.1] - 2023-08-15

### Fixed

- Unregistering was not working correctly when the same callback was added for
  multiple events. (#75)

- At times, the chosen marker would disappear from the selections during
  rapid mouse actions, leading to an exception being triggered.
- Sometimes, during mouse actions, when the tooltip animation disappeared, the
  marker information was null. With a new mouse action, when other tooltip 
  appeared, the marker transformation went from null to null, which caused an
  exception.
