# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2023-08-24

### Fixed

- Implemented deep copying of received values to ensure the original data 
  remains unchanged during subsequent modifications.
- detach() won't fail on not initialized chart.
- detach() removes the canvas if it was created by the lib. 
- When the labelLevel was set to a value other than 0, the axis labels were 
  not displayed correctly.
- From now orientation is a persistent setting too.
- Order-independent channel input processing.
- Filtered out markers were taken into account for measure type, and waterfall
  chart dimension axis ranges.
- When measure set on color channel, the color changes alongside the color range
  instead of blending the starting and ending colors.

### Added

- Event objects are containing the element of the chart which the events were 
  triggered on.
- Drawing events are containing drawing geometry in an improved format.
- Missing TypeScript definitions for Event objects added.
- getCanvasElement() introduced to expose the underlying HTML canvas element.
- forceUpdate() introduced to trigger chart re-rendering.
- Converter functions to convert between canvas and relative coordinates.
- Orientation new default parameter: "auto".
- New dataseries 'unit' parameter introduced, undocumented unit parsing from 
  parameter name string removed.
- New parameters for the chart: subtitle and caption.

## [0.8.1] - 2023-08-15

### Fixed

- Unregistering was not working correctly when the same callback was added for
  multiple events. (#75)
- The plot.marker.label.color setting now works in a way that modifies the
  previously calculated color based on the transparency channel of the color
  setting. (#144)
- When rapidly clicking multiple times while the selection animation has not
  finished, the library is aborted due to an exception.
- At times, the chosen marker would disappear from the selections during
  rapid mouse actions, leading to an exception being triggered.
- Sometimes, during mouse actions, when the tooltip animation disappeared, the
  marker information was null. With a new mouse action, when other tooltip 
  appeared, the marker transformation went from null to null, which caused an
  exception.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-07-12

### Fixed

- Missing Area/line marker rewireing (on orientation change,
  base dimension change) added.
- Fixed line drawing for line segments partially outside of the plot.
- Fixed label position for marker in polar origo.
- Axis labels won't shift if their 'side' style changed but
  their 'position' style is also changing or they are fading out anyway.
- Axis labels won't fade in partially when fading out but their 'position'
  style is also changing.
- Axis titles fade-in/out when changing position instead of traveling through
  the chart.
- Axis titles are rotating with the axis during cartesian/polar coordinate
  system change.
- Fixed unintentional separate animation steps for specific dimension change
  animations.
- Fixed JS exception mishandling as C++ exception when thrown from webassembly.
- Fixed showing big numbers greater than 18446744073709551615.
- Fixed mouse events/selection on line-segment markers.
- Vertical polar area chart tangential borders "follow" the coordinate system
  instead of being forced to remain straight.

### Added

- New&renamed mouse events: pointeron, pointermove, pointerdown, pointerup
- New drawing events: draw-begin, draw-complete, plot-area-draw
- 'step' channel config parameter for set interlacing/tick/label intervals
  on axises.
- 'plot.areaColor' style parameter added.
- Marker click works mid-animation.
- Various aggregator functions for channels beside previous sole summing:
  'min()', 'max()', 'mean()', 'sum()', 'count()', 'distinct()'.
- New, fast bubble chart algorithm.
- Data records can be specified via objects beside arrays.
- Area/line rewiring animation (aka. connection) can be configured separately
  in animation options.
- WASM Binary size reduction.

## [0.7.2] - 2023-05-09

### Fixed

  will remains.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-02-23

### Fixed

- Fixed the UnPivot.convert method not modifying the original data object.
- Axis line, labels, ticks, interlacing and guide can be set to auto.

  further on despite the cancellation.

### Added

- 'regroupStrategy' animation option introduced to control the algorithm for
  transitioning between charts having the data grouped differently on them
  (containing a different set of categorical dataseries).
- Multi keyframe animation support (one animation through multiple chart).
- 'style' property returns the style object only filled with the user-set
  values, all the values (returned by this property till 0.6.x) can be get
  using the new 'getComputedStyle()' method.
- detach() method added to JS API for enabling proper garbage collection.
- Actual animation can be stored for later reuse through Anim.Control.store()
  method.
- animate() returned promise is not an animation controller object from now on,
  but has a member promise called 'activated', which resolves to the controller.
- New style parameter, 'numberScale' has been introduced for setting the scale
  system for big numbers e.g.: K M B T or k m bn tn.
- Improved default options for animations: marker geometry, marker fade-in,
  marker position, coordinate system, title.
