# Code of Conduct

Our community welcomes participants from around the world with different
experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

Whenever we come together as a community, we are here to support each other, to
learn from each other’s successes, and to encourage our members to become the
Vizzu users they visualize.

As a member of the Vizzu community, you accept to follow the below Code of
Conduct.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members,
users, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible
or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language?
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
    and learning from the experience
- Attempting collaboration before conflict
- Sharing your knowledge and ask questions
- Giving credit when the credit is deserved
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Violence, threats of violence, or inciting others to commit self-harm

    advances

    comments, and personal or political attacks

    address, without explicit permission

- Abuse of the reporting process to intentionally harass or exclude others

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action and
will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently a user
or contributor in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing this community or the project.

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to us anonymously through
[this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1IRUYnCo3QPa1ZiYDV4oYGgc5lac). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project
maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of
any incident.

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

- Correction Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior
    deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence: A private,
    written warning from Project maintainers, providing clarity around the
    nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was
    inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
- Warning Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of
    actions. Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
    interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
    those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
    includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external
    channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
    permanent ban.
- Temporary Ban Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards,
    including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence: A temporary ban
    from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for
    a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people
    involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of
    Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a
    permanent ban.
- Permanent Ban Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of
    community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment
    of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of
    individuals. Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public
    interaction within the community.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where
the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to
still report it. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we decide to
take no action than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may
result in an individual or group to feel like they can no longer participate in
the community. Reports deemed as not a violation will also allow us to improve
our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous
situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report even if you are
only an observer.
