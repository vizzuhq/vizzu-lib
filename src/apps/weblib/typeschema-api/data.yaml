          Name of the data series. It will be the unique id of the series to 
          reference it in various parts of the API, mainly in {@link Config.Channel} and
          {@link Data.Record}. This name will also be used by default for Axis and 
          Legend title.

          Type of the data series:
          - 'dimension' - categorical data containing strings 
            (dates should also be added as strings); 
          - 'measure' - continuous data containing numbers. 
          If not set, the library will attempt to determine the type based on 
          the type of the first value. Number type will result in measure, 
          string type will result in dimension.
