            If no animation settings are passed to Vizzu, it will use an automatic 
            setting depending on the actual configuration of the chart. This behavior can be
            overridden via the animation setting parameter.

            The animation between two states of the chart can require the transitioning
            of several different chart properties. These properties are grouped into 
            separately configurable animation groups.

            The parameters can also be set for the animation as a whole. These settings
            rescale the durations and delays of the animation groups to the 
            specified total delay and duration.
