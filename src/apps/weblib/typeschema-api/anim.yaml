      If no animation settings are passed to Vizzu, it will use an automatic 
      setting depending on the actual configuration of the chart. This behavior can be
      overridden via the animation setting parameter.

      The animation between two states of the chart can require the transitioning
      of several different chart properties. These properties are grouped into 
      separately configurable animation groups.

      The parameters can also be set for the animation as a whole. These settings
      rescale the durations and delays of the animation groups to the 
      specified total delay and duration.
