  Channel:
    description: |
      Channels are the main building blocks of the chart. Each channel describes
      a particular aspect of the markers (vertical & horizontal position, color, etc.)
      and connects them to the underlying data. A single measure and an ordered list of
      dimensions can be on each channel. The dimensions will recursively slice the
      measure on the channel. The channels are represented on the chart as an 
      axis or legend.
    type: object
    properties:
      title:
        description: |
          This title is shown on the axis or legend corresponding to the channel.
          If 'auto', the title will be the name of the measure attached to
          that channel.

  Channels:

      Channel configuration. 
      A data series' name or a list of the data series' names can be used as a 
      short-hand - instead of the {@link Config.Channel|channel object} - to set data series 
      for the channel. Setting a channel to null will remove all data series from it.

          Parameters for the X-axis, determining the position of the markers on the 
          x-axis - or their angle when using polar coordinates. 
          Note: leaving x and y channels empty will result in a 
          chart "without coordinates" like a Treemap or a Bubble Chart.

          Splits the markers as all the other channels, but have no 
          effect on the markers' appearance. Thus, it only works with dimensions.
