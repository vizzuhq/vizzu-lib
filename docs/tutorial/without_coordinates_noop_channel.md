# Without coordinates & noop channel

Certain chart types have neither measures nor dimensions on the axes such as
treemaps and bubble charts. This is a case when the `noop` channel comes in
handy for grouping and stacking elements in these kinds of charts.

To get to a treemap, we have to detach all dimensions and the measure from the
axes and put two of them on the `size` channel, whereas the other dimension is
still on the `color` channel.

```javascript
chart.animate({
    config: {
        channels: {
            y: {
                set: null
            },
            x: {
                set: null
            },
            size: {
                attach: ['Genres', 'Popularity']
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Getting from a treemap to a bubble chart is simply by changing the geometry to
circle. This bubble chart is stacked by the `Kinds` dimension that is on the
`size` channel - this is why the bubbles are in separate, small groups.

```javascript
chart.animate({
    config: {
        geometry: 'circle'
    }
})
```

In order to show all bubbles as one group, we use the `noop` (no operations)
channel for the `Genres` dimension. The `noop` channel enables us to have a
dimension on the chart, that doesnâ€™t affect any parameter of the elements, only
their count.

```javascript
chart.animate({
    config: {
        channels: {
            size: {
                detach: ['Genres']
            },
            noop: {
                set: ['Genres']
            }
        }
    }
})
```
