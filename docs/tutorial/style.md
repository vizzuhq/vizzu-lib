# Style

`Vizzu` offers a wide variety of styling options when you want to personalize
the look and feel of your animated charts. The styling properties are organized
into a hierarchical structure. Font styles, when set on a higher level of this
hierarchy, will be inherited on all lower levels. You can use absolute sizing
(`px`) and relative (`%`, `em`).

Similarly to all other parameters of the animate method, `Vizzu` will animate
the changes in the styling of the charts. This provides an excellent opportunity
to check and control the effect of these changes.

You can find below the complete list of the available styling properties and
their default values.
