# Stacking explanation

In the following animation you can see an example how selecting different measures and
dimensions cause different stacking behaviour in the chart. 

First we set the x channel to a dimension and an arbitrary constant value to
illustrate stacking. Then by changing the constant to a measure the markersâ€™ width change
according to the values. Finally when the dimension is removed the bars get
ordered by the measure.
