The `Vizzu` examples are grouped into four categories.

- [Preset charts](./presets/index.md): Examples of the well-known chart types
    `Vizzu` offers a shorthand for, as described in the
    [Chart presets](../tutorial/chart_presets.md) chapter of the Tutorial.
- [Analytical operations](./analytical_operations/index.md): A collection of
    examples to help you apply animated transitions that show another facet of
    the data under analysis. Also a great source of inspiration for finding the
    next chart when you're building a story.
- [Static charts](./static/index.md): Examples of well-known chart types
    configured with the original chart type-agnostic syntax of `Vizzu`.
